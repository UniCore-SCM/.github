> üöÄ **What's Next?**
> UniCore is currently in **Alpha** and under active development. Our roadmap includes integrating a full **AI/ML pipeline** for predictive analytics and adding secure payment processing with **Stripe**. This tech stack will grow as we build out these powerful new capabilities!

This is the official GitHub organization for **UniCore**, a modern Supply Chain Management (SCM) platform designed to provide businesses with real-time visibility, predictive insights, and state-of-the-art security.

## üöÄ What is UniCore?

UniCore is an integrated SCM tool that helps businesses track, monitor, and optimize their supply chain operations. By leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), our platform goes beyond simple data tracking to offer:

*   **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast demand, identify potential risks, and optimize operational efficiency.
*   **Secure Data Management:** Your business data is protected with modern, passwordless authentication and end-to-end encryption.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Choose between self-hosting your data for maximum control or using our secure, managed cloud solution.

Our mission is to make advanced SCM capabilities accessible to businesses of all sizes, enhancing decision-making and driving growth.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **ü§ñ AI & ML Powered Insights:** Utilize predictive models for demand forecasting and operational planning.
*   **üîë Passwordless Security:** Modern, phishing-resistant authentication using **Passkeys (WebAuthn)**.
*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Flexible Data Hosting:** Choose between a self-hosted environment or our secure, fully-managed UniCore cloud with end-to-end encryption.
*   **üîí Data Isolation:** Each client's business data is stored in a separate, isolated, and encrypted database.
*   **üìä Customizable Data Structures:** Define your own data schemas through an intuitive UI and easily upload data via CSV.
*   **‚ö° Modern Tech Stack:** Built with high-performance technologies like **FastAPI** on the backend and **Angular** on the frontend for a fast, responsive experience.

## üíª Our Repositories

Our platform is divided into two main repositories:

| Repository                                                               | Description                                                                                                                              | Build Status                                                                                                                             |
